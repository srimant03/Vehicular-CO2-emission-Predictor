Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict the potential CO-2 emission from a vehicle. Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset through several data visualisation and exploration techniques. Used PCA and t-SNE for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset. Achieved a highest R2 score of 91.6% on the test dataset.
